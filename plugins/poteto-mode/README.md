# pstack for Codex

This repository ports [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack) from Cursor to Codex.

The engineering principles and playbooks remain pstack's. The runtime integration is native Codex:

- Codex collaboration agents instead of Cursor `Task` and `poteto-agent`
- verified Codex model and reasoning routes when the collaboration tool exposes them, with session-runtime inheritance as the fallback
- Codex memory and task history instead of Cursor transcript paths
- Codex browser, computer-use, GitHub, and automation tools
- `.codex/skills` for global and project-local skills

The port currently contains 44 skills, including `poteto-mode`, its playbooks, `swarm`, the workflow skills, and 21 engineering principles. The 0.14 port adds `bro`, `no-comments`, `technical-writing`, Babysit, Shipping, Autopilot-full, Autopilot-stack, Orchestrate, and safe worktree cleanup.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HustleCoding/pstack-codex.git
cd pstack-codex
./scripts/install.sh
```

The installer backs up any same-named global skills before writing to `~/.codex/skills`. It does not touch unrelated skills.

Restart Codex or start a new task after installation so the refreshed skill catalog loads.

## Configure

Ask Codex:

```text
Use setup-pstack and configure pstack with your recommended Codex settings.
```

The setup skill writes `~/.codex/pstack/config.md`. When the active collaboration tool exposes model and reasoning-effort selection, the configuration routes verified Codex models by role; otherwise agents inherit the session runtime. It also controls fan-out, isolation, memory, verification, and publication policy.

## Use

Start rigorous work with:

```text
Use poteto-mode. Diagnose this bug, prove the root cause, fix it, and verify on the real surface.
```

You can also invoke focused skills such as `how`, `why`, `architect`, `arena`, `swarm`, `interrogate`, `blast-radius`, `tdd`, and `teach`.

PR monitoring uses the bundled `poteto-mode` watcher. It requires Bun and an authenticated GitHub CLI:

```bash
bun --version
gh auth status
```

The watcher installs its pinned dependencies on first use and reads GitHub state without granting merge authority. Babysit stops at merge-ready. Shipping requires an explicit request to merge, land, or enable merge when ready.

## Check upstream

```bash
./scripts/check-upstream.sh
```

The script compares this port's recorded upstream commit with the current `cursor/plugins` main branch. It reports pstack changes without modifying the port.

After porting an upstream update, replace `UPSTREAM_COMMIT` with the reviewed upstream commit and run:

```bash
./scripts/audit.py
```
